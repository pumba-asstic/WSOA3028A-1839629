     <p> <h1><strong>I AM A DESIGNER BEFORE I'M ANYTHING ELSE </strong></h1><br> I live my life in full colour and full jean textures, yes it might come across as cold and worn our and outdated, but so is my style and way of thinking and approach to life
            this site is as raw , outdated and textureful as they come. enjoy as we both venture and experience the life behind the curstains of the runway.

    <p> About Guyheadd is a brand owned and created by Christiaan van de Merwe, who is located currently in Johannessburg, Sandton.
        he grew up in Knysna, Western Cape,South Africa. he is a ex-army boy, Christiaan is a young man in his late 20's that fancies fashion
        he has an interest in it and has always been inspired by how clothing is created, how the process is taken from the beginning up to the final product
        this website will be dealing with how he started out as a boy that left the army, after serving 3 years and being a very big afrikaaner and rugby fan and player
        it will deal with how the <strong>Guyheadd</strong> brand started out, as it is a brand that cateres for males and females, that want strong comfortable
        jeans to work in, on the famrs, in the office and on construction sites. 
    </p>
   
    As the brand is exploring new adventures, we decide to expand and make the Guyheadd Jeans available at the following retail stores
    <ol>
        <li>Selected woolworths stores</li>
        <li>All Edgars</li>
        <li>Any TFG outlet</li>
    </ol>
