   <h1> Character Rationale</h1> 
   <article class="blogs"> <b><u>Charactersheet and Rationale  for Christiaan van de Merwe.</u></b>
      <p>Christiaan van de Merwe. is a man that is very well organized, in since of his creation, i created him to the type of person
          that might look like they are falling under the typical "Afrikaans -boere" sterotype, but his personality is not at all, his is the type that grew up with 
          not so understanding parents, that were stricts in how he should behave and conduct himself. he grew up the same way any wihte afrikaans boy did, with all of the privileges.
          and wants. since he is the only boy out of 6 chilren, they treated him with alot of responisbilites.
          Christiaan is created in such a way that i could also educated myself on this timeless, effortless fashin trend, since it is part of my
          everyday clothing i wanted to do research through him, so that i also have some sort of understanding as to why "jeans" are so timeless and effortless. 
          how i wouold like to incoprorate Christiaan into the website, is using styling and making the website feel more of a guy that knows what the is doing, when it comes to creating, styling and making jeans
        from the mintue you enter or visit the site. i want it( the side)  to be as jean like as possible. i got this inspiration from a company created by two black man, that create custom jeans for their clients.
        company's name is "Tshepo Jeans" this is where I go the inspiration from.
