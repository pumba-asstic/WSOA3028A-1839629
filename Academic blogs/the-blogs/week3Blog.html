        'Hypertext' began as a term for forms of hypermedia( human-authored medisa that "branch or perform on request")ooking at how Ted Nelson and Wardrip-Fruin definded the Hypertext in 2004 
    <p> the Hypertext is that is operates textually , itruns to counter defintion of hypertext in the literary community that focusses soley on the counter the defintion in the research community that is privilege tools for knowledge work over media>
        how Fruin breaks this topic up in how Nelson has structed it , is that hypertext can also be hypermedia, the hypermedia is a text to the body of written or picurual material that is interconnected in a complex way.
        he says that Hypermedia are braching or performing presentation which respond to the users action , systems of prearranged words and pictures, it means that forms of writing which branch or perform on request.

    <p>
        Historically Hypertext is based on it making sense to note the literal community, the defintion of hypertext has shifted so that it is applied to almost
        exclusive chunk-style media, it's focus is on knowledge work rather then media, to maintain its defintion of hypertext's is the possible structurees that
        was broader then the chunk-style with the rise of the web(which is a chink-style hypertext media system)
    </p>
    <p><strong><i>Hypertext</i></strong> is broken up into 4 parts.
        <ol>
            <li>No matter the type of server3 on euses the user interface is the same is made so the users do not have remember or learn or understand new user interface"receipes" 
                the model of the hypertext with text input has proved suffiecienty powerful to express all the user interface
            </li>
            <li>Provides a more powerful communication tool, server program can generater a hypertext view represnting, it allows existing data to be put on the "web" without further human effect</li>
            <li>it is Extendable system for introducing new formats for multimedia data </li>
            <li>Hypertext information is transmitted on the network in logical( mark up) form, the clients to interpet in natural way in platform, colors and other human interfaces resources</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    hypertext heps us as useres communicate with the web, it might be hased on may different things, but what its means to me is that it helps us navigate through different web documents.
    yes it might include different hyper media files that, and yes htese media files also help the user engage and interact with the web in the most efficant way possible. 
    what Fruin says that in order to understand the hypertext we need to have the knowledge of both the literary community and the computer science community and how these two commnunities interlink to each other.
