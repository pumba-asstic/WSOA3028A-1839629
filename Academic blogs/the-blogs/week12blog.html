height="490">


<p>What Marc Faddoul talks about in this tweet is that the new tech companies, such as Tiktok have created and developed an algorithm that is practising biasness and discrimination (gender, race, age, ethnic groups, and appearance. </p> 
<p> Marc is saying that these algorithms are a problem because people then do not get to full experience these social platforms, cause if you are a person that falls under a specific appearance look your suggestions for people you should follow become of people that fall under the same category. i.e if you are a black women your suggestion pages will be other black women, if you are a man with a beard your suggested pages will other men with beards like your </p>

looking at this link it speaks about how people fall into their own pre-set biases, and how we could try to avoid them and not fall to our bias on the internet or anywhere in our personal lives</p>
<p>What Marc is saying about these systems is true, bases on the fact that some of these systems that are out into place into these social media platforms are created to discriminate against people of certain groups and colour and yes, they do limit the fact that we as social media users cannot experience these platforms fully because of they have filter our suggestion pages and the content we can see and what we cannot see.</p>

<p>They filter your content based on interest your might have shown by looking at a page for longer than 15 minutes, you might spend 25 minutes on a page/ users that shows interest in car- drag racing and the next time you search something on either Facebook, Tiktok, and or Instagram, Twitter or YouTube  the first few pages that will pop up are those of the people that drag race or show interest in such content. Same goes if you spend too much time on a mom-to-be page your suggestion pages will be mom-to-be content and content creators. </p>
<p>The problem starts with the fact that now your social media pages and interest have changed because you showed too much interest on a certain page or specific content, just like how if you searched to purchase a new home furniture piece 5 years ago, and your research a similar piece today the same pages and websites that your searched on 5 years ago will be page that they suggest you, to look at. The problem is how they filter and box us (as users of these platforms) and our data and social media usages and interest are shared and made public information, where our interest become suppressed because of the way their algorithm works and the fact that we cannot change these algorithms. </p> 
<p>In order for us to beat these systems we need to confuse them so that we don not create a usable and recognizable pattern on how we spend our time on these platforms, we need to change our behaviour in order to fall bias to these systems and to also be careful in how we engage with content creation and content exploration.</p>
