Reflection on Sheena Magenya’s Article (2020) Making a feminist Internet in Africa and why Africa needs African feminism
<p>What Sheena Magenya talks about making a feminist internet, is not about making the internet for women only, or making the internet only suit and be for women only, she talks about making the internet for all groups that were previously and still are being put at the back and being discriminated against, bully, and not having equal rights or privileges as their male counter parts</p>
<p>It is only fit to have representatives of those marginalized groups, be it part of the LGBTQI+ community, Black women, Women in general and the overall black body on the internet. This helps with shaping the internet in a way that is suitable for all the disadvantaged group, giving those same groups the same amount of airtime and rights to speak about their experiences on the internet. </p>
<p>This helps with the fact that some groups will not be misrepresented due to the fact the their do not have the correct representations. Taking it back the reasons why Africa and Africans need a feminist internet and feminism, is because of the disadvantages that Africa as a continent had to endure during the times of being enslaved to the western world. We (Africa) need to have the correct representations spoken from Africans and not Europeans trying to speak and represent Africa from their perspective. </p>
<p>Looking at the different groups and different associations that are run by women that have the urge to change the internet, to making it more inclusive of the rest and not just them. Groups and associations such as the AWC -TBTT (all women count-take back the tech) an association of progressive communication women’s rights (APC WRP). These group help the regular person be more a feminist, and have feministic views on the internet and shape it the way that is inclusive of everyone </p>
<p>Sheena Magenya say that Africa has a lot to contribute even though it heavily inspired by the western and colonizing countries. Africans are still using the internet daily, with over than 25 million users in each country. We (Africa) in my own personal view, we need more African stories told through an African perspective to help the future users of internet will see other people that look like them making a difference in the world through their voice on the internet. </p>

<p>In these weird times of a global pandemic. We saw how the internet become an inseparable part of the human experience and in the mist of COVID-19, we saw the need to create more spaces that need to be filled with the correct representing and correct stories.
Giving an example was with the Marvel movie Black panther where their used parts of the different African cultures, such as speaking isiXhosa in the Wakanda and the wearing of the Basotho blankets but these cultures were some how misrepresented and the audience had said that tried but no hard enough. </p>
<p>In my opinion if the internet were filled with such information, there would have been misrepresented. The fact that we need a feminist internet is that fact, when I search hairstyles, I often find hairstyles that hairstyles that are suited for white women, and I must put the word “black” before I’m able to find what I’m looking for.  So to chance that I need to change my behavior on the internet, cause the internet will not shape it self on it own. Just like Charlotte says in her Tedx talk, about howt he internet looks and behaviors according to its users.</p>
<p>So as the users of the internet we need to change the way we behavior on the internet in order to make it inclusive to those marginalized groups. </p>
