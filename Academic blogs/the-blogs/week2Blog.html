    <h1>THE WORLD WIDE WEB</h1>
    <article class="blogs">
      <p>what is the world wide web? as described by Bernes in 1994<br>
    he says that the world wide web(www) is defined by the following:
    <ul>
        <li>The idea of a boundless information world in which all items have a reference by which they can be retrived</li>
        <li>The address system (URI) which is the priject implemented to make the world possible, despite many different protocols</li>
        <li>A network protocol (HTTP) used by native WWW servers giving performance and features not otherwise available</li>
        <li>A markup language (HTML) which is every WWW client required to understand and is used for transmissions of basic things such as text, menus and simple omn-line help information across the net</li>
        <li>The body of data available on the inernet using all or some of the proceeding listed items</li>
    </ul> 
    the web is built from differnt types of protocols that need to be follwed in order to create or host a website on the net, these protocols are important to understand for each users of the web as well as the developers of the web. looking at the first Protcol<strong><i>The Universal Resource Identifiers</i>
    </strong>
    known as the URI, these are stings used as addresses of objects on the web, they are encoded members of the universal set of network addresses. it forms addresses for any object as set of the protocol parameters, the parameters encode into a concise string which is
     <ul>
        <li>prefix: to identify the protcol and encoding </li>
        <li>URI: new scheme: the address, this is for the internet news articles newsgroups (NNTP) protocol</li>
    </ul> the prefix is the "http" in the proceeding. it indicates the address space.
    </p>
    <p>This brings us to the second protocol <strong><i>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</i></strong>
also known as the HTTP protocol , this protocol is used to transferring information with the efficienct necessary for the making hyperttext jumps. 
this protocol is a simple request and response protocol, it does not only transfer HTML documents, eventhough HTML is comprehensive required of the web users and developers. it is used to retrieve documents in an unbounded and extensible set of formats. this also falls under the internet protocol,
that includes reabable text-based style to file transfer(FTP) and the network news(NNTP) protocols that are used to transfer news and files on the internet.
HTTP is stateless this means it runs ove TCP connections, this becomes efficient when link from one object may lead equally  well to an object stored on the same server. this leads us into the third protocol which is <strong><i> markup language </i> </strong> 
it is also known as HTML protcol. this is the common basic langauage for the interchange for hypertext. this a language and much of the fabric of the webis constructed out of it
it is designed to be simple, and easily produced by both people and programs. the markup language that does ot have to use HTTP, it can be used in hypertext emails, it id defined to to be a language of communication and it flows over the networks, there is no requirment that files are stored in HTML servers it may store files in other formats.

    <p>the web protocols are very interesting in how these protocols are used in regulating the way that information is shared and how to keep track and communication to the web servers and its users (Humans) such as the HTTP protocol is the Hypertext transfer protocol, this a system that is used to share information between the browsers and the servers that makes information accessible to the users.
    In my opinion this has changed the behavior of how people used the internet, yes given the fact there are different protocols put in place in how users are able to access and get information, but in how these protocols change the behavior of the user is that the amount of information is never regulated, looking at how the wiki websites are setup (anybody can now interact and create different documents on the internet.
    these protocols has changed how people see the www, the fact that they might be sites that be harmful to the devices that are being used to connect to the internet. they have tired to change the HTTP protocol in making it safier for user to use and visit such websites. the HTTPS protocol helps in warning users that some sites are not safe to use, multiple reasons might cause these warnings, such as viruses being injected into the site.
