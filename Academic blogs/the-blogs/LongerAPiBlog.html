        <p>The External framework that I use and tried to implement was that google map API, so that the users were able to find my characters store. And where they can purchase their favourite local jeans. </p>
        <p> Why this API is useful for my site is the fact that it is directly linking the “store” location to the website, making it easier for user to find the store and interact with it, the technical part of implementing this web API was a little bit challenging, in terms of having  fetch function and having it return the map back to the screen so that there is some form of interaction to the site.</p>
        <p> The Web API necessary because it mean that any users can get the coordinates of where the store is no mater where in the world they are located, the alternative to a web API like a google maps is having something that give you direction something like where you can request a ride such as  Uber, Blot or any other person taxi vehicle that will use the coordinates on the site to get you to the store. </p>
        <p> I choose this framework because it was one of the easier one to implement and because I know it has a direct like to how my site is structured and how I would like to have it structed the technical impact on it is very limited since it uses its own script to be generated and deployed to the site. it could have some negative impact on the loading of the map after 30 days, because google maps only has an option where the API keys for the maps is available for a month after they have been generated. So I have embedded the map with the ( iframe) tag so that the map is there for in case the google maps no longer runs nor generates the map after 30 days.</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZE8ODPL2VPI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p> A reflection on the whole technical process of the creation of this website lacked a lot to be honest, it was difficult trying to implement the different features that I wanted to add to the site, features like having a scroll bar with all of the blogposts( summaries); the styling of the pages, being using to create a unique user experience, an experience that is fitting to the website and all of it’s juices. I wanted to implement a system where the reader of the blogposts could have some form of feed to the blogposts and write their thoughts about my thoughts, to create maximum usage of the interactivity of the site.  a system that allows the user to be able to get some form of communication subscription to the website and that they are able to order for custom designer jeans, just like how TSHEPO jeans does his operations on his site. </p> 
        <p> The site still has a lot of improving to do to in order for it to be deployed for the world to see and interact with fully. The things that could be improved is the styling of the whole website, the coding of the website, especially the JavaScript. 
            Having an embedded objects such as YouTube videos, Spotify playlists and google maps, is something that I am working on implementing correctly and as uniquely as possible. It would be a great achievement if it were implemented now. At least the web API code is trying to work as much as it can, despite the error that I cannot fix. </p>
