    <h1>THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE</h1>
    <setion class="author-details">Author: Nompumelelo Masilela         Words : </setion>
    <article class="blogs">
    <p>The medium is the message. The message it seemed was the content. what McLuchan is saying is that wee need to look at the operation and the practical fact in the medium is the message.
        it includes the personal and social consequences of any medium is an extention of ourselves. it is a result from the new scale that is introduced into affairs by each extention of ourselves or any technology.
         it has a negative result from how the automation and its new patterns of human association that tend to eliminate jobs, the automation also has a positive side to it,
         where it creates new roles for people, it is said to create depth of involvement work and human association our preceding mechanical technology.
     </p>

     <p> McLuchan is giving a characterist of the media, it is said the that content of any meduim is always another medium, this means that the content is always based from another meduim, he gives an example of , the content of writing a speech is the written words.
         he talks about the psychic and social consequences of the desings or patterns as they amplify or accelerate the exisiting processes.</p>
    <br>
   <p>it is in the way we use the different mediums to either create or engage with the things, yes it has a socila affect on the environment that can be a negative affect to it,
    looking at the internet and how humans prefer doing things on the internet rather then engaging the the himan species, this has accelerated to the fact the people will trust that an object is correctly manifuctured if it is done by a automation rather then a human
    we tend to forget that inorder for these automation to be in existens we had to create them, even if it has some negative effects to it. </p>

<br>
the message is in the medium rather, then the medium is the message. in my understand this simply means that it is in the way that the medium is used that creates the message. the message is usually embeded into the way the medium/ media is used.
