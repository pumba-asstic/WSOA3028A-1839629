        <p>Reflection on the Hassenzahl and Tractinsky reading about the User Experiences from 2006 </p>

<p>The UX (user experience) has become a buzzword in the field of human computer interaction(HCI) and interaction design. It focuses on the empirical studies of the user experience, Hassenzahl and his team introduce the issue in how they do UX research. <b>The issue</b>:  it looks at how the technology leads to a particular experience which mediates knowledge, attitude, purchase, it looks at the interdisciplinary approach to the empirical study of the ux.</p>
He then mentions Don Norman that gives 3 different perspectives that the UX research is looked at.

	<b>Beyond the instrumental: </b>it is addressing the human needs that go beyond the instrument that they are using. Looking at the task that is user centered. It looks at the emotional usability, it has an underling human needs, where there is a need for humans to be stimulated, to perfect their skills and knowledge to grow. 
There is a common goal that is to enrich the current models of product quality with non-instrumental aspects to it. It helps create a more complete and holistic HCI. This where the UX experience goes beyond the product/ instrument.
<p>Looking at how some makeup brands create tools to apply their products, but then you will some other users that have the need to use their hands instead of the tool because they either want a quick application process or just to experience the product in a different state</p>.</li>
<li>
	<b>The Emotion and Affect:</b> it focusses on the affects and the emotional aspects of the interaction. This is where the UX takes human perspective; interested in understanding “the role of affect as an antecedent, a consequence and a mediator of technology use”. It focuses on the positive outcome.
It gives 2 basic way to do research on UX via the emotions and affects:
<ul>
<li>
    Stresses on the importance of emotions as a consequence’s ff the product use </li>
<li>
	The importance as the antecedents of the product use and evaluative judgements.</li>
<p>It looks at how the UX design is affecting the users on an emotional side and how that affects how they experience the overall design of the product. Looking at the Gustbowl experiment that they did, the experiment had different affects on the people that partook in the experiment. (The Gustbowl sends clear unobstructed messages in different spaces). The emotional and affect motivates the motivation user interface, an interface that either motivates it users or give them so form of positive interaction.</p>  
</ul>
<li>
	<b>Experiential:</b> it focuses on the nature of the experience, it gives 2 aspects to technology, the 
situatedness and the temporality. This where the experience is important, this is where the users can experience the unique combinations of the elements that were sued to create the UX. 
The Experiential has positive outcomes and a positive impact on one’s wellbeing </li>
</ol>

<p>The User experience can be seen in the fact it needs all 3 of these aspects for the users to have a full and fulfilling experience with the product at hand, taking this back to the UX design of a website. A designer needs to consider how their website will come across to user or a viewer, how it will make them feel and what type of experience does the design want the users to experience while looking at their website. </p>
UX design is important to how your site will be received by the masses.
