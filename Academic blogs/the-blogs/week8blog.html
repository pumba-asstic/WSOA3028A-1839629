  <h1>Reflection on the methodology and results of the Mark Graham et.al’s case study “TOWARDS AS STUDY OF INFORMATION GEOGRAPHIES: mutable augmentations and mapping of the geographies of information  2015</h1>
 <section class="author-details"> Author :Nompumelelo Masilela 		words: 986</section>
  <article class="blogs">
  <p>Geographies information is about the places that matter because they shape, how we are able to find and understand different parts of the world, the geographies augmentations is much more than just representation of places, they are part of the place itself, they shape rather than simply reflect it, the ITC (international telecommunications union) decide to create immutable mobiles thar it the mobility and adaptability of information that provides the motivation to constrain the mutability of information through creation, the characteristics is that these mobiles have the ability to crystallize  informational layers pf places in a moveable container to create particular “geographies of information”. </p>
  <p>It is the evolution of information that goes beyond immutable mobiles, the (im)mutable augmentations, characterized by the layering pf dynamic information across and over the geographies spaces. The group looks at how the geographies of uneven access to contemporary modes of communications and the uneven geographies of participation and representation are also evident and in some cases are being amplified rather than alleviated, they comprehensively show one of the important facets of contemporary geographies: that geographic information itself is characterized by the hose of uneven geographies. </p>
  <p>They classify the changing geographies, as where people can, create and access information about and from almost any participation and representation or new layers of digital augmentations. The methods that they take to conduct they research is broken into 3 categories.: 
    <ol>
      <li> <stong><b>Geographies of access and enablement</b></stong>: it is the exploration, who is has access to the technologies and services essential for digital communication, participation, and representation. This category looks the distribution of technologies and services thar are essential for digital communication, participation, and representation. It looks that the countries with the most internet accessibilities. Analyzing the data from the 2011 world bank stats on data on the internet users and total population</li>
      <li><strong>Geographies of participation</strong>: it is how the digital information is generated., this category looks at 3 different variables of how people can access and create participation on the internet. <i>Domain Names (content produced on the open web), GitHub Users (measuring of contribution on largest open software repository) and Wikipedia edits (measuring contribution to largest open encyclopedia)</i><p><i>Domain names</i>: looks at research provided in 2014 by the ICANN (internet corporation of assigned names and number) it looks at the amount of gTLD (generic Top-Level 
        Domains) and ccTLD (country codes Top-Level Domain) they are all over the world and look at where the most participation comes from either for ccTLD or gTLD, where both these types of domain name s are required to create any content that is linked to the internet
        </p>
      <p><i>GitHub Users</i>: the distribution of collaborative coding the domain names are one possible metric for participation and is important to also review other possible indicators of content production. With GitHub being one of the largest code hosting services in the world, the research that is looked at and analyzed is taken from GitHub archives in 2015 these include all public events and logged by the service, the research then shows the number of GitHub users and commits by the users relative to the number of internet users. </p> 
    <p><i>Geographies of Wikipedia contributions</i>, Wikipedia is an open platform that allows all internet users to contribute and offers an indicator of more generalized level of content creation and contribution. The research shows that the geography of participation on Wikipedia is highly uneven, shown in the research sheet of the participation that Wikipedia has on a monthly to yearly bases</p></li>
      <li><strong>Geographies of representation</strong>: which parts of the world’s is active in content creation and which is not created.  This is to understand the contours of representation with the (im)mutable augmentations of the world, analyzing the geographies of a series of different digital representations. Google search (the world’s largest search engine), OpenStreetMap (world’s largest open map) and Semantic Web (one of the worlds’ largest collaborative knowledge bases) and Geonames the world’s largest open gazetteer.<p><i>The google search engine</i> and the geographic content that it either contains or omits can have significant impact on the representation of places. The research reflects the number of retrieved pages and mentioning that country. the research shows the pages that were searched and to which country has the most searches</p>
      <p><i>Mapping OpenStreetMap </i>is the world’s largest road map and it’s because it is free and open source, it is used as a base map for thousands of other digital platforms and services </p> 
      <p><i>Contours of semantic webs: freebase and geonames</i>the semantic web is a movement to make the web more efficient by crating common frameworks that allow data to be easily shared and reused across sites, services and places. There is 2 backend databases for semantic web: freebase: is the general purpose knowledge base, containing a database of millions of entities including geographic ones. The Geonames: is the world largely used gazetteer and directory of place names. </p>
    </li>

    <p>What the group wanted to prove was the fact that to have geographical spaces and places currently represented we need to look at they were created before technology and how they were moved and transformed into the digital spaces we now know. The research that they have shown and conducted is part of how some countries are still trying to grow and develop in terms of technology, so it shows the unevenness of how certain countries view and represent their geographical spaces. Like Graham said the misrepresentation of geographical spaces is as good as them not existing if nobody can find them. 
      It shows that the fact that some countries do not have stable internet connection or internet at all, shows how the lack of the digital participation and contribution to how they would their digital spaces to be represented and shown on the internet.
