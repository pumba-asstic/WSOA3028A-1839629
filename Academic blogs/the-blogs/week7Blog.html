    <h1>Reflection on the Semiotic Design, Analysis of Hypermedia.</h1>

 A article written by Elio Toppano in 2009.
Toppano is a Lecturer at the University of Udine, in the department of Mathematical and computer science. He writes about the semiotic framework that is inspired by Greimas in the Generative trajectory of meaning, in the design and analysis of hypermedia. 

<p>He looks at how this framework works and in how it allows the designer to control the semantic coherence and the optimization of communication during the development of hypermedia.
The article starts with the three ground principles of the semiotic framework: <storng>the narrative approach; the semio-structuralist  model and the communication perspective-based theory</storng> The description of these three principles are as follows, the <i>narrative approach</i> is related to how Bathes the father of semiotics says that to maintain narrative, it needs to be trans-cultural, trans- historical, and trans-linguistic, he says that it is suitable to be transposed from a dynamic medium to another, meaning that the narrative need to be so translucent that it can evolve into other mediums and medias. â€œby narrating we impose an order, we transform a set of unstructured incidents into a sequence of continuous, closed and coherent events.</p>
<p>The second principle is the <i>Semio-structuralist model</i>  this is the Generative trajectory model pf meaning, it analyzes the narrative production, where meaning has to pass through four levels in order to be made. The first level is the <b>deep semio narrative level</b> it is representing the fundamental values to be transferred and arranged into a scheme the semiotic square. The second level is the <b>semio narrative </b>; this is where the abstract narrative structure is described by the concept of actant and narrative schema, this is where the abstract structure is created into a narrative scheme that is more understandable by the audience. The third level is the <b>Discursive level</b>, where the abstract narrative components are translated into a concrete figurative and thematic element. This is where the meaning starts to take shape, for just being a abstract narrative into something that is understandable and readable by the audience. The fourth and final level is the text structure , this is the external manifestation in which the discursive elements are now being represented by the media assets. This what we see when we communicate with eachother, over any social media and communication platforms, this is where the letters and signs and words start to form something, such as a sentence that we use to read and make clear meaning of things.</p>
<p>The third principle is the <i>Communication perspective</i>  this is where the designer and the user communicate through the hypermedia within a social and cultural context.</p>
Semiotic is a model it that is put forward through the potential interaction between the user and the artifact, they are fully inscribed into the text itself, where the actual empirical sender ( who is the designer ) and the empirical receiver ( the user) in how they connect by means of an instrumental medium

<br>
In how semiotic and hypermedia  work together is in how the user and the designer get to communicated through the symbols and text that the designer put forward for the user to use without them ever having any physical connection between the two.
<P>Toppano speaks of how the designer can explain how the meaning emerges from their design choices, this the valuable for the user as well, just like creating annotated wireframes and how we can create and explain to our users how certain design choices were chosen in order to create meaning and understandability for the users, in making the hypermedia more user friendly and how the design and the meaning making in these choices affect not only the designer but the user /receiver as well.</P>
<p>Creating a user friendly website with meaningful design choices goes beyond the semiotics framework, the magic is in the way you as the designer decided to take a narrative and transform it into making sense to both you and the user of the site, it is in how you decided to keep the narrative translucent so that it can take up other mediums and forms.</p>
