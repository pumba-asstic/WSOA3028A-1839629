    <p> The Radical Ai Podcast is online talk show, hosted by Dillion and Jess, where they discuss anything radical, topics that are not in the norm and ideas that are radical and fresh</p> 
    <p> in this episode 8 titled<i><u>Love, Challenge, and Hope Building a movement to dismantle the new Jim code with Ruha Benjamin</u></i>where they interview Dr Ruhullah Benjamin, who is an associated professor of the African American studies at Princeton University and the founder of the Just Data Lab and also an author of People’s Science Bodies, she writes on stem cell frontiers and Race After Technology Abolitionist Tool for the NEW Gym Code. She also investigates the social dimensions of science, medicine, and technology with the focus on the relationship between innovation and equality, health and justice, knowledge, and power. </p>
    <p> They speak about the Jim Code, and the how algorithms and Ai systems have implicit biases encoded into them, pre-hand, she talks about the automated soap dispensers that would not work if there was a darker or lighter hand in front of it. talked about the bias that are instilled into the technology that we as designers and developers might not have teste before getting the technology out there, Dr Benjamin talks bout the blurred line between science and technology, the line that is blurred not only in practice but also the analytical categories as well. </p>

    <p>The Line is blurred between technology and science, where the normal users do not know the difference, science and technology are somethings that are intertwined and woven together, we all see them as an invention of something new or the research of something old. With the new technology that is being release and invented we need to make sure that we don’t make new tech that is discriminative and or carries biases that are pre-set, we need to think pf the way we have our own biases that we live by , and  we might prescribe them to others without us noticing, just like howe think the rich are all deserving of good quality health care because they have the money to pay for it and the poor are less deserving of such services.  We also have the bias of thinking that all public health care workers are rude and incompetent and useless, without considering the facts that they work in unruling conditions, overworked and under paid. </p>
    overworked and under paid. </p>
    <p>The bias that we have of our as designers affect the way that our designs will look and how they will be received by the masses.  Just because my site caters for a males does not mean that I need to use colours, layout and images that are appealing to the male population only. Also, the fact the bias that I have must not allow my design to discriminate anybody, whether their gender or race. </p>
    <p> Designers need to be careful in how they designs look and how they will feel to the masses, just because the site or the design is designed with a specific user in mind does not mean that it will only be used and seen by that one person, we need to be aware of our unconscious  bias and beliefs that we project onto other.  </p>
