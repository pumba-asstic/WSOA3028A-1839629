    <h1> GUYHEADD UX AND UI </h1>
<section class= “author-details” Author: Nompumelelo Masilela 		Words:498 ></section>
<article class =”blogs”>
<p> This is an reflection that talks about the ux and ui of the Guyheadd website. The UI and UX is what makes the website appealing to the audience/ target market. It is something that get improved with every update and changes made to the site. </p>
<p>Something that is constantly being renewed and changed each time, is very difficult to deal with especially if the audience is a broad space. Getting the correct input to the ux and ui that is responsive and the enhances the user experience and what and how the user gets to interact with the site.</p>
<p>making changes one has to consider :
	<ul>
        <li>Responsiveness: how it feels to the user, the buttons are working and functioning. the fact that the user can interact with the site on any device. </li>
        <li>The colours: the fact the colours are appealing to the users, and it works to the site, and it goes to the responsiveness of the site. the tiny bits that help with the make the site a site, and make it look like a side, to the viewers. </li>
        <li>The experience: that needs to be checked. What sort of experience is the developer trying to get across the fact that the site needs to compliment the responsiveness to it. </li>
</ul>
<p>These changes that were made, were trying keep the responsiveness of the site in mind, each change to the ux and ui make a big difference. Trying to keep things working and being responsive at the same time was very difficult to make.  Making the blogs works be in way that works </p>
<p> looking at the UX and UI of this side, it was all designed around the logo of the colours , it was made to appeal and fit in with the logo of the website. Yes there’s a lot things that could be changed and fixed that doesn’t only just fit in with the logo and the audience / target market, but it would fit in with the a larger market and not just appealing to the target market only</p> 
<p> Changes that could be made to the site are: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>More colour corporations , colours that are contrasting  with each other</li>
		<li>Images, Gifs and videos that are related to the content of the website, things that are appealing to the audience.</li>
        <li>Having the content being centred to fit both mobile and desktop viewing of the site. doing that through css styling and designing</li>
        <li>more exploring through responsive and usable design that help with the overall feel of the website. This can also be done though user questionaries that come with suggestions. </li>
</ul>

There are other things that could be changed and as we know it that web designing is new stopping, it always developing and growing to make it more useable and appealing to the audience and creator.
