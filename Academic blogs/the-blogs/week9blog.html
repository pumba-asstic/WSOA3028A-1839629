  He talks and identifies the inequalities that we face, not matter your demographic status, race, gender, and social status. The three levels of digital inequalities are: 
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Access to the digital technologies</strong>: emerging technologies including the internet -of-thins and artificial intelligence -powered systems. This is the literature on internet access, it deals with the unequal access to internet, even with the access to the internet through a mobile device, still has it effect and limitation to the amount of internet one can access. It is referring to the Gap between those who internet access and those who do not have access to the new forms of information technologies. 
      Talks about the limitations that mobile internet has and that this divide should be adapted through theory-based research
      </li>
      <li><strong> Inequalities in Digital skills and technology </strong>:are reviewed and connected to discourse on new forms of work, sharing economy or gig economy. It is differentiating binary inequalities in internet access from inequalities in skills and uses. It focuses on the online participation and social media presents, differentiating active content creators from passive consumers and identifying user characteristics of specific social media platforms 
        It focuses on the individuals ‘online activities for recreational purpose and outside of work. This talk about the fact that people might not have the skills and the access of the internet, to interact and create online things outside of the workspace, it talks about that social economy that doesn’t get to grow due to the fact that the first divide is still evident to the second divide, this divides us on an economical level. And skill setting 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Discourse on the outcomes</strong>: in the forms of benefits and harms form the digital technology use is taken up, combining, and extending the previous digital divides, this one looks at the outcomes of these divides giving both the benefits and harms that they have. It refers to the differences in gains from internet use, participation patterns that are similar. This relates to gaps between the individuals capacity to translate their internet access and use into favorable offline outcomes. It looks at the offline outcomes from the internet use in economic social, political, and cultural terms. This is the link between the antecedents demographic characteristic, technology attitude and skills and differentiated internet use on one hand and outcome on the other hand
          It talks about the good that we have when accessing the internet and how it can harm us at the same time 
          </li>
  </ol>

  <p>How these divides affect me and society in general, is the fact that these divides will affect you no matter your social standing, and your privilege, just like how Lutz says it , the ones that were previously at a disadvantage will take time to catch up, which means that they will forever be at a disadvantage, and it plays back to the fact that these divides will always be here.
    These divides affect me and my technological growth in terms of how long it took for our country due to apartheid to even get a taste of internet access. It still plays a part in how far behind our country is with the 4IR, and how much longer are we going to have to play catch up to the other countries in the world? This divide plays part in our future generations not having access to improving and revolving technology
