    <p><strong>The different between user interface design includes the visual design and the interaction design.</strong>
        the UX makes the interfaces useful, the UI makes interface beautiful amd readable. The UX helps users accomplish goals, UI makes emotional connections.
        the UX design is done first then the UI is done second. the UX is emplyed accross products, interfaces and services, UI only pertains to interfaces. 
    </p>
    the benefits of UX 
    <ul>
        <li>It is user centered and value based</li>
        <li>Increased Trust: this help the designer have mental maps</li>
        <li>The reduction of longterm costs: helps reduce the develpment costs and customer support and errors, the UX lens means that the design process is centered around outcomes and creative problem solving</li>
        these benefits help with having a good UX design before making the website public to users to engage with it
    </ul>
<p>
    UX has different effects and laws that it comes with. here are the following Laws and effect of the UX 
    <ol>
        <li>the <i>VON Restorff effect:</i> it is having similar objects, that are presented and one that differes from the rest that is mostly likey to be remembered</li>
        <li><i> HICK's Law: </i> it is the time that it takes to make a decision that increases with the numebr and complexity of choices</li>
        <li><i>Fitt's law:</i> the time to acqure a target is a function fof the distance and the size of the target</li>
        <li><i>Zeigarnik effect:</i> it refers to how people remember the uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks</li>
        <li><i>Serial Position Effect:</i>it refers to users  having a propensity to best remember the first and the last items on the series.</li>
    </ol>
    this shows how a good UX can effect the way that users engage or disengage with your website. these effect will help in designing of the website and how you want the users to engage with the content that is displayed.

<h2>The Basics of UX and UI design</h2>
this has 3 steps that help with just the basic design of any UX and UI 
<ol>
    <li>Readablity and legability: the <i>Readablity</i> refers to the ways in which the blocks of text or large complex chunks of information are arranged on a Page, the <i>legability</i> refers to how the typeface or font is designed.</li>
    <li>Visual Weight: Everything that is placed in compositions has weight, it is usally perceived through, size; shape; form; space; isolation; percieved or real.</li>it comes with different way to place objects on a page such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Symmetrical balance: elements used in one quadrant fo the design has similar visual weigth</li>
        <li>Asymmetrical balance: Elements with the design offeset each other are different but look balanced</li>
        <li>Radical balance: Elements arranged around a central point and may be similar</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Balance and Alignment: the alignment is the placement4 of the visual elements so that they line up. good alignment is inivisible it does not have a literal line in the design</li>
</ol>
having good UX and UI design has proved that the users are usually impressed by how easy it was in using and engaging with the web page, it was not confusing or all over the place.
