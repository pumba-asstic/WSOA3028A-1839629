<p> Reflection on the Bergstrom and West, 2019 case study about the criminal machine. </p> 
<p> Bergstrom look at a research that was conducted by Xiaolin Wu and Xi Zhang in November 2016, where they had claimed to have algorithms that can detect if a person is a criminal or not, using a mugshot, it is said that their algorithm has a 90% accuracy, where their computer can detect if you are a criminal or not. </p>

<p>Bergstrom then looks at the creator criminal detection. Dr Cesare Lombroso that studied the anatomy  of a hundred criminals, in an effort to create some theoretical point of view of criminality, he(Lombroso) says all criminals are born with both the physiological drive and the physical feature, that cause them to be criminals, what the two engineering researchers( Wu and Zhang) did was try to create what Dr Lombroso theory and feed it to a computer that has the code and the algorithms connected into it already that test and put the Dr Lombroso theory to the test.</p>
<p> Bergstrom then continues to say that the algorithm that the two researchers created is only good as its unbiases, this shows that the way they went about fixing their algorithm in detecting which criminals from non-criminals, was a total mess. Thinking about the fact they have a machine that could possibly detect by only your facial structure and classifies you as a criminal, even if you don’t not have the perceived characteristic of a criminal both physiological and physical. </p>
<p> the way this study is shows that people create biases to determine which group you fall under, just by the way you look and how you are structured facially, the problem with the Wu and Zhang’s algorithm is that one can have the facial structure of what a perceived criminal would like and still be classified as a criminal just based on how you look and not based on your physical or psychological behaviour. You are already placed in box that does not suit you and being classified and seen as a criminal before committing or being convicted of any criminal doings </p> 
<p> Bergstrom and his colleagues  disagree with the Wu and Zhang algorithm saying it completely bias, to say that their algorithm can detect if you are a criminal based on your facial feature, and that it cannot be accurate because of how humans being will have the same features as a criminal, people have similar structures, the algorithm was also based on a smile, if your face changes when you smiled and the algorithm picked it up that your smile changed your features you were classified as a criminal.</p> 
<p> To conclude the criminal machine does not exist without any biases, because it has pre-set settings that detect human biases, machines are fed what we as humans feed/ encode in them</p>
