        <p>This book was written in 1998 by Luis Borges, where he talks and refers to the universe as a library that exits, is made of rooms that are shaped like hexagons (rooms contain of a certain number of bookshelves, and a number of books that are not identical in terms of content, but all have the same writing style and format, this could refer to how the internet and the world wide web is set up and built -There’s a format that is followed and built from- Borges also mentions that the 25 natural symbols have adoption was by luck it could be a coincidental( this brings up a question that word ever written in the English language could have been combined by coincident or not?). He refers to “men” the universe keepers as librarians that keep track and take care of each book ever written. He states that the idealists of the world argue that the hexagonal rooms are unnecessary and that the change of the hexagon to a circular shape will provide more books, they refer to the circular chambers containing enormous circular books (this book is refed to as God). </p>
        <p>In his format that he states is that each line in the book consist out of 8 black letters with 25 orthographic symbols (set of conventions such as the ordering of letter/spacing and blocking of the letter, much like the way our grade one teachers taught us to put a finger in between each letter of the word) and that there are no 2 identical books in the bookshelves, these books(content) have possible combinations of 22 orthographic symbols. Borges’s theory can be related to the “infinite monkey theorem” (it’s like putting a monkey Infront of a typewriter, and it will produce very word ever written), just as much as the library of babel theory or algorithm goes, that every word ever written, can be written is already and has been written</p>
        <p>How this theory relates to the internet and the ideas of it in this new age. Just like how the idealist saw the hexagons as an overload of space that is unnecessary intake of space. This can be referred to the noise on the internet, in how the information is being overloaded and as internet users the information might tend to be overwhelming, by him saying that there is no book that is identical as well as looking at the algorithm, that there’s no way of knowing what you are reading is the future, the past or the present. This brings it back to the way information is set up on the internet, the overload, theirs is also no way of telling what you are reading is the truth, even what is written there, according the way Borges has it is that it could be true or not , it could be something that is referring the past or the future, but there no way of knowing because there’s no two books that are identical in content</p>
        <p>Just the as the same goes for the content of some documents on the internet, there is no way I will find the exact same information in the wording in another document. How this relates to the ideas of the internet, I believe that the same algorithm is being applied in the new age internet, even if the uploaders and the content creators do not realize it. EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE IT IS EVEN THOUGHT OUT.</p>
